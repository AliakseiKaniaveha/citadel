# Application Overview

Just try it - https://to.be.defined.

The idea is to reveal the difference between automated test types and visualize a way how tests are interacts with a
system internals.

It maps all tests run against the app to application units. There are to main functions:

* Show which units are affected by an individual test (or a set of tests filtered by package, type or criteria)
* Show which tests affect a unit.
